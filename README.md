A sample project that hits the Giphy API to retrieve trending photos which are then displayed in an infinite scrolling ListView. The app demonstrates basic usage of Retrofit, Butterknife, Picasso and the model-view-presenter pattern. With this framework in place I'll be adding Dagger to inject the service dependency. Then add a mock service and write a few sample unit tests. Lastly, I'll modify the UI so that it requires service call chaining and I'll wrap the Retrofit call in RxJava.
